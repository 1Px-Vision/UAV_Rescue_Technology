# UAV_Rescue_Technology

In recent years, Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) have become crucial for Search and Rescue (SAR) missions due to their versatility, mobility, and accessibility, bringing about a technological revolution. 
This study explores the current state of UAS deployment in SAR, highlighting the integration of multi-sensor technologies, categorization of UAVs, payload assessment, and the potential of Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) in future applications. These applications include many tasks, from rapid aerial surveys to detecting survivors and hazards in expansive areas. UAS can also serve 
as a lifeline for delivering essential supplies to remote regions, aiding communication in areas with poor network coverage, and supplying real-time environmental data for informed decision-making. 
Although challenges such as regulatory compliance, payload limitations, and battery life still exist, the future of UAS in SAR is promising. Advancements in artificial intelligence and autonomous 
technologies will enable drones to execute complex missions independently. UAS systems will amplify coverage and search efficiency, and advanced sensors such as infrared-thermal imaging, LiDAR, Radar, 
LoRa/WSN, IoT, healthcare sensors, and cellphone signal detection will enhance situational awareness. Drone swarms could establish ad-hoc communication networks and conduct extensive searches, while 
medical payloads offer immediate assistance in remote locations. Machine learning and AI will enhance image recognition capabilities for identifying survivors and hazards. UAS technology is 
a compelling solution to enhance SAR operations, but ongoing research and development efforts are necessary to overcome existing challenges and fully unlock their potential in future applications. 
Adherence to evolving regulations is crucial for seamlessly and efficiently incorporating these remarkable tools into SAR missions.
